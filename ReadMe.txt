   * General scene
      * The player just taps (F / Up), (F / Down) to match the rhythm.


   * Boss scene
      * When the small character on top of the screen goes to the red area, the Boss scene starts. 
      * The music tempo and note speed gets faster.
      * A Fever gauge pops up on the bottom of the screen.
      * It increases every time the player attacks the node.
      * When the gauge is full, the hit score increases.        
      * If the player retains the combo, the fever gauge fills up faster.
